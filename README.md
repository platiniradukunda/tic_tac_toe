Tic Tac Toe Game

This is the first big project in my journey of learning software development. I hope you enjoy playing my first game.

For the development of this game, I used HTML, CSS and javascript. HTML enabled me to create the webpage for my game. 
CSS was crucial for the game creation as it enabled me to style my webpage. I was going for a minimalistic design. 
I utilized javascript to code the logic and functionality behind the game.


To be able to to play this game, you will need to download four files and store them in the same folder;
1. the index.html file
2. the style.css file 
3. the app.js file
4. the sounds folder

Enjoy the game!!!
